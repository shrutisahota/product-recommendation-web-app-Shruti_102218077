# product-recommendation-web-app-Shruti_102218077
Build an AI-powered Product Recommendation Web Application focused on furniture products. The app will recommend products based on user input and generate creative product descriptions.
This project is a machine learning-driven web application that integrates multiple AI domains—Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Generative AI—with full-stack web development and analytics visualization. It recommends furniture products interactively with AI-generated creative product descriptions, providing analytics on product data.

Features
Interactive AI-based product recommendation conversational interface.

Creative product descriptions generated using Generative AI.
Image classification for product categorization.
Text analysis for product grouping using NLP.
Semantic search through vector database integration.
React frontend with FastAPI backend.
Data analytics page displaying insights on product dataset.
